Description: Functions for fitting growth curves using SIM (Shape Invariant
    Model) with random effects (Beath, 2007) involved in time independent covariates 
    and computing some public health statistics, such as age at peak velocity (apv), 
    peak velocity (pv) and height (or weight) at peak velocity (ypv). This package is   
    based on R package sitar and SIM model, and the basis of this model is that a 
    population has a common characteristic curve or function, which by shifting and 
    scaling can be made to have the form of any individual curve.
